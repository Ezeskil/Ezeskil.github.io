## Introduction
We structure our website using a Martini Glass narrative:

Author-driven stem: a concise, guided walkthrough of key insightsâ€”how hospitalizations peaked by region, and how traffic flows responded to lockdown measures.

Reader-driven mouth: an open, interactive dashboard where you can explore the weekly hospital admission rates and traffic anomalies for each Danish region.
